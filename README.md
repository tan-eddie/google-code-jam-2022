# Google Code Jam 2022

## Qualification Round (2-3 April 2022)

Questions 1 to 3 were super easy.

1. Punched Cards: easy
2. 3D Printing: easy with a greedy (?) approach
3. D1000000: easy after realising to sort
4. Chain Reactions: Pretty neat question which required reversing the graph into a tree. I originally though the recursive solution is easy to implement but would exceed default Python recursion limit of 1000 for hidden test set. So I decided to implement an iterative solution instead. However my approach was wrong and didn't properly handle all the cases. Gave up as it was almost 3am and I was tired af.
   Next day: I thought the round had ended so I hop on to look at the solution. Turns out there was still 10 mins so I keep working at it and I got a solution that passed all 3 test sets but I was 8 minutes late :(
5. Twisty Little Passages: Did not attempt.
